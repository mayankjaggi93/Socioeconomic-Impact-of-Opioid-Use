# Project 1

In this project, you should address a question related to the Opioid Epidemic in the spirit of [investigative journalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investigative_journalism).
The report for this team project should be 4-5 pages.
The first two pages should be a newspaper-like article, with an introduction, the question you are answering, a brief description of your sources, and your conclusions rooted in empirical evidence.
The following pages should include an explaination of your methodology and the tools you employed.
You should commmit your code on a GitHub repository, in a manner that your work can be recreated, but do not commit huge amount of data.


## ARCOS Retail Drug Summary Reports

The Automated Reports and Consolidated Ordering System (ARCOS) is a data collection system in which manufacturers and distributors report their controlled substances transactions to the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).
ARCOS provides an acquisition/distribution transactional records of applicable activities to the DEA involving certain controlled substances.
This information is collected and compiled by DEA in accordance with law for determining quota, distribution trends, internal audits, and other analyses.

## Washington Post

The Washington Post gained access to ARCOS, as a result of a court order.
This year-long legal battle for access to information was waged alongside HD Media, which publishes the Charleston Gazette-Mail in West Virginia.
The Washington Post sifted through the data from 2006 through 2012 to provide an analysis of the shipments of oxycodone and hydrocodone pills across the United States.
They subsequently released their findings to the public.

For instance, the following database contains pertinent entries
